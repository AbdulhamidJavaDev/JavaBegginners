History of Java
	- Why Java?
	- History
	- java vs c/c++

Java Features
	- Object Orientation & OOPS [Class, Object, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism]
	- Platform Independence
	- Architecture neutral, simple, secure, dynamic and distributed
	- Portable, secure and Robust
	- Multithreaded, High Performing

Java Basic Overview
	- Basic Class syntax / Hello World!
	- Class, Object, methods/functions, statements, variables, packages, keywords, comments, data structures
	- Naming conventions
	- public static void main(String[] args){}
	- java installation, IDE Setup
	- running Java programs in IDE
	- JVM, JRE and JDK
	- javac, .java files, .class files, and just-in-time compiler
	- running Java programs via the command line

Java Data Types
	- Primitive data types [inte, char, long..]
	- Non-primitive data types [Object, Array, String, Enum]
	- Data type conversions [typecasting/widening]
	- Array in detail

Java Operators
	- Arithmetic operators [+, -, *, /, %, ++, --]
	- Assignment operator [=]
	- Comparison operators [==, !=. >, <, >=, <+]
	- Logical operators [&& , || , !]
	- Bitwise operators
	- instanceOf operator

Java String in detail 
	- String initialization
	- String operations 
	- String Immutability
	- Strig Pool
	- StringBuilder() and StringBuffer()

Java Control Statements
	- Conditional statements
		- if
		- if-else
		- switch-case]
	- Loopin statements 
		- while
		- do-while
		- for
		- for-each
	- Execution flow control keywords 
		- continue
		- break
	- Ternary operator [A?B:C] 

Access Restrictors & Modifiers, Scope
	- default, public, private, protected
