Problem 1:
Create a class named IntDataTypeExample with a main function. 
Declare two integer variables and assign them some values. 
Print the addition of these two variables in the format: "Addition of <number1> and <number2> is = <addition_result>". 
Print the subtraction of these two variables in the format: "Subtraction of <number1> and <number2> is = <subtraction_result>". 
Print the multiplication of these two variables in the format: "Multiplication of <number1> and <number2> is = <multiplication_result>". 
Print the division of these two variables in the format: "Division of <number1> by <number2> is = <division_result>". 
Print the remainder of the division of these two variables in the format: "Remainder of the division of <number1> by <number2> is = <remainder_result>".

Problem 2:
Create a class named BooleanDataTypeExample with a main function. 
In the main function, declare two boolean variables, assign them values, and print them in the format: "Value of boolean variable <variableName> is = <actualVariableValue>".

Problem 3:
Create a class named FloatDataTypeExample with a main function. 
In the main function, declare two floating-point numbers and print the addition of them in the format: "Addition of float numbers <number1> and <number2> is = <additionResult>". 
Similarly, print the subtraction, multiplication, and division of these two numbers.

Problem 4:
Create a class named DoubleDataTypeExample with a main function. In the main function, declare two floating-point numbers and print the addition of them in the format: "Addition of double data type numbers <number1> and <number2> is = <additionResult>". 
Similarly, print the subtraction, multiplication, and division of these two numbers.

Problem 5:
Create a class named LongDataTypeExample with a main function. In the main function, declare two long numbers and print the addition of them in the format: "Addition of long data type numbers <number1> and <number2> is = <additionResult>". 
Similarly, print the subtraction, multiplication, and division of these two numbers.

Problem 6:
Create a class named StringDataTypeExample with a main function. In the main function, declare two string variables and assign them some values. 
Print those values in the format: "String variable <variableName> = <variableValue>".
Print concatenation of the above two variables separated by ":".
